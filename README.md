# EIT Simulation and Reconstruction (EIDORS + MATLAB)

This repository contains MATLAB scripts that simulate and reconstruct Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) scenarios using the [EIDORS](http://eidors3d.sourceforge.net/) library. The reconstructions use a Gauss-Newton one-step difference solver (`inv_solve_diff_GN_one_step`).

---

## üîß Requirements

- MATLAB (R2018+ recommended)
- [EIDORS toolkit](http://eidors3d.sourceforge.net/)
  - Add to your MATLAB path using:  
    ```matlab
    run('eidors/startup.m');
    ```

## üìÅ Contents

### `simple_anomaly_reconstruction.m`
- Simulates a single circular anomaly in a homogeneous medium.
- Performs voltage measurements and reconstructs conductivity.
- Plots:
  - True conductivity
  - Reconstructed image
  - Voltage difference plot

---

### `dual_anomalies_motion_simulation.m`
- Simulates two moving anomalies (one bright, one dark) in opposite circular paths.
- Reconstructs each time frame with added noise.
- Displays all frames in a tiled figure.

---

### `lung_breathing_simulation.m`
- Uses a thorax-shaped model to simulate lung conductivity during breathing.
- Simulates left and right lung conductivity variations through a breathing cycle.
- Reconstructs and saves a video `eit_lung_sim.avi` comparing true vs. reconstructed frames.

---

## üìΩ Output

- Videos:
  - `eit_GN.avi` ‚Üí from `dual_anomalies_motion_simulation.m`
  - `eit_lung_sim.avi` ‚Üí from `lung_breathing_simulation.m`

- Visual results help compare simulated phantom vs. reconstructed image.
